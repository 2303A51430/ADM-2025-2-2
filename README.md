## How to Run
1. Open Google Colab: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload the notebook to Google Colab
3. Install dependencies (if required) by running:
   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Execute the notebook cells sequentially.

## Uploading to GitHub
After completing the assignment in Google Colab, upload the notebook to your GitHub repository:
- **GitHub Repository:** [2303A51430/ADM-2025-2-2](https://github.com/2303A51430/ADM-2025-2-2)
- Save the notebook as `.ipynb` and commit it to the repository.

## Dataset Information
The datasets used for experiments are sourced from platforms like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or synthetic datasets generated using Python.

## Results
Each lab experiment contains analysis, visualizations, and insights derived from the data mining techniques applied.

## Contributions
